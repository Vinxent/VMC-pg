			<p style="text-align: center;">George Huang</p>
			<p style="text-align: center;">Currently in tenth grade at St. George's, George Huang is an aspiring student looking to positively influence society in creative ways. For him, music was a perfect outlet to express his ideas and begin creating positive change at a small scale, within his community. Prior to discovering his passions for music, his passions were in mathematics and art. His hobbies outside of school include playing volleyball, listening to music, and drawing, as well as painting. As a co-founder of the Vocal Music Club, as well as the current treasurer, George hopes to use music to spread awareness of issues within society. At a smaller scale, he hopes to ignite the passion for music of other students and to help others realize that helping one's community can be as simple as listening to a performance.</p>
